# Planet-Shader-Blender
This is a blender shader that allows for the creation of fully procedural planets. This includes Surface, atmoshere and cloud shaders all bundled up into a nice and easy to use shader group with easy to use shader parameters. 

Please note this is a cycles only shader

I am going to continue to work on this shader with plans for the following features:
  -many more types of noise to generate continents/oceans
  -polar ice cap generation
  -better cloud generation including volumetic clouds
  -generation of rings
  -generation of city lights
  -choose between realistic and cartoon style planet shading
